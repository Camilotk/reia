= Reia

Welcome to Reia (pronounced RAY-uh), a Ruby/Python-like scripting language for
the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM).

== Usage

Reia provides three ways to execute programs:

* The Reia interpreter, located in bin/reia.  This runs Reia programs from the
  command line without needing to compile them first.
  
* The interactive Reia interpreter, located in bin/ire.  This provides an
  interactive environment (a read-eval-print loop) for running Reia programs,
  or just exploring the language.
  
* The Reia compiler, located in bin/reiac.  This compiles Reia to .beam files
  which may be used in conjunction with Erlang code.  The main use of the Reia
  compiler is for compiling the self-hosted parts of Reia itself.  Programs
  compiled with it are more limited than ones run with the standard Reia
  interpreter.

== Programming Reia

Reia is under active development and therefore changing constantly.  For the
most up-to-date information on how to program in Reia, consult the Wiki:
