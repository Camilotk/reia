h1. Reia

Welcome to Reia (pronounced RAY-uh), a Ruby/Python-like scripting language for
the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM).

h2. Compiling Reia

To compile Reia, you will need a working installation of Erlang (at least 
R12B-3) as well as the "rake" tool.

Reia requires Erlang version of R12B-3 (5.6.3). The latest version of Erlang 
is available here:

http://www.erlang.org/download.html

You'll also need to install rake.  Instructions are available at:

http://rake.rubyforge.org/

Once you've installed rake, type:

 rake

under the Reia source tree to build Reia.

h2. Installation

If Reia has compiled successfully, type:

 rake install
 
to install Reia systemwide.  This will install the "reia" and "ire" scripts in
/usr/local/bin.  Be sure to add this to your path (or move the scripts 
elsewhere) if you'd like to be able to use Reia systemwide.

h2. Usage

Reia provides three ways to execute programs:

* The Reia interpreter, located in bin/reia (or just "reia" if you've installed 
  Reia systemwide).  This runs Reia programs from the command line.
  
* The interactive Reia interpreter, located in bin/ire (or just "ire" if you've
  installed Reia systemwide).  This provides an interactive environment (a 
  read-eval-print loop) for running Reia programs, or just exploring the 
  language.
  
* The Reia static compiler, located in bin/reiac (not installed systemwide).  
  This compiles Reia to .beam files which may be used in conjunction with 
  Erlang code.  The static Reia compiler is intended for compiling the 
  self-hosted parts of Reia and is not intended for general-purpose use.
  
h2. Implementation

Here's some thoroughly interesting implementation trivia about Reia:

* Leex-based scanner (with second pass for indentation sensitivity)
* Yecc-based grammar
* Compiler transforms Reia abstract forms to Erlang abstract forms or BEAM 
  bytecode
* Partly self-hosted: most core Reia types are written in Reia

h2. Programming Reia

Reia is under active development and therefore changing constantly.  For the
most up-to-date information on how to program in Reia, consult the Wiki:
