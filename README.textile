h1. Reia

Welcome to Reia (pronounced RAY-uh), a Ruby-like scripting language for the 
Erlang virtual machine (BEAM).

h2. Compiling Reia

Reia requires Erlang version R12B-3 (5.6.3) or later. The latest version of 
Erlang is available here:

"http://www.erlang.org/download.html":http://www.erlang.org/download.html

To compile Reia, type:

 rake

under the Reia source tree to build Reia.

h2. Implementation

Here's some thoroughly interesting implementation trivia about Reia:

* Leex-based scanner
* Yecc-based grammar (a Neotoma-based branch is also available)
* Successive parse transforms convert Reia parse trees into the Erlang abstract
  format, then into BEAM/HiPE bytecode
